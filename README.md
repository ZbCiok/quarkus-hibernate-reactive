# quarkus-hibernate-reactive
###### (under development)

Hibernate Reactive works with a reactive Mutiny SessionFactory. Most operations of this interface are non-blocking, and execution of SQL against the database is never performed synchronously.
### Run:

./mvnw package

java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
